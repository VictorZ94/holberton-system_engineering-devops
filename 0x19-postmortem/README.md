The impact was the process to deploy a new application it set back. Fortunately, was an internal error and was detected before get out to production.

## Root Cause

The issue was triggered by the firewall, among the settings up that I did, enable the firewall, this by default no enable the port 22/TCP for SSH connections. Manually must indicate it to the firewall that allows port 22/tcp connection remotes via SSH. Otherwise, all attempts via SSH the firewall it will deny.

To resolve the issue, the engineer had to destroy the server and start one again and setting it up and install it all again. Having special matter when it manipulates the firewall in a server.
